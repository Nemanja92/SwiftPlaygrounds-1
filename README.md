# SwiftPlaygrounds
A collection of Swift playgrounds to be used for learning and exploring the Swift language.  Our goal is to collect useful Swift examples, idioms and ideas and distill it into handy searchable Playgrounds.

Swift playground files are stand-alone files that XCode can open.  So you can open any of these and play with them.  

We also have included an XCode project that contains a blank iOS app.  This serves two purposes.  First, if you want to try something out you have a blank app ready for it.  Second, you can keep this project open and use XCode to search through all the playgrounds for what you need.
